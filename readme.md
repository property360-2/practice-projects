# Front-End Practice Projects

This repository contains various front-end projects that I’ve built to practice and improve my web development skills. These projects range from simple UI elements to more complex applications, all created to enhance my understanding of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and other front-end technologies.

## Projects

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different practice project. The projects may include:

- UI components (e.g., buttons, form elements)
- Functional apps (e.g., to-do lists, games)
- Responsive designs
- Accessibility improvements

Feel free to explore and check out how each project is structured.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure and semantics
- **CSS3** for styling, including flexbox, grid, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** for functionality, DOM manipulation, and interactivity
- **Git** for version control
- **VS Code** as the code editor

## Purpose

The primary goal of these projects is to:

- Practice building user interfaces
- Experiment with different front-end libraries and frameworks (if applicable)
- Focus on web accessibility and responsive design
- Sharpen problem-solving and debugging skills
