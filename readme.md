# Practice Projects

This folder contains my personal practice projects.

These are small HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exercises created to help me improve my front-end web development skills. Each project is self-contained and meant for experimentation, learning, and testing different web features or design ideas.

## What You'll Find Here

- Simple UI component tests 
- Styling practice with CSS
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Responsive layout experiments
- Accessibility improvements

> Note: These are not production-ready projects. They're made just for learning and practicing.

Feel free to explore and learn with me!
